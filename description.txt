------------------Basic Linux/Unix shell------------------


System:
• The attached code is written in 6 separate c files.
• It functions as a Basic Linux Shell which implements the following commands:


◦ Internal commands:


▪ cd (Change the shell working directory.)
• -M (will jump to directory given by the whole path name)
• -N (will jump to directory inside the current directory as path will be given)
• --help

▪ echo (display a line of text)
• -e (will put new line wherever \w will be inserted)
• -e (will end the text wherever \c will be inserted)

▪ pwd (print name of current/working directory)
• -M (avoid all symlinks)
• -N (use environment to get pwd, even if it contains symlinks)


◦ External commands:


▪ ls (list directory contents)
• -a (do not ignore entries starting with .)
• -1 (denote inode number and directory name simultaneously, present in particular directory)


▪ cat (concatenate files and print on the standard output)
• -d (display $$ at end of each line)
• -n (display numbering of each line)


▪ date (print or set the system date and time)
• -r (get the gmt time)
• -u (print date and time in proper format)


▪ rm (remove files and directories)
• -d (remove directories)
• -v (remove files and also shows what is being done)


▪ mkdir (make directories)
• -v (new directory will be formed, by printing some message)
• -m (make new directory and set its mode);


• The major errors handled and assumptions made throughout the program were mainly the 
ones:
◦ Wrong commands
◦ Wrong directory name
◦ Wrong format of date
◦ Directory already exists
◦ Wrong path given
◦ Wrong mode for creation of directory
◦ Directory doesn’t exist
◦ Wrong command line option
◦ Can’t delete directories by default
◦ file not present
◦ The user would always enter a command (even though wrong)


• Test Case:
◦ ls
◦ ls -1
◦ ls -a
◦ cat file1
◦ cat file1 file2
◦ cat -d file1
◦ cat -n file2
◦ date
◦ date -r
◦ date -u DD/MM/YYYY/HH/MM/SS
◦ rm nameoffile
◦ rm nameoffile1 fnameofile2
◦ rm -d nameofdirectory1
◦ rm -v nameoffile3
◦ mkdir dir
◦ mkdir dir1 dir2
◦ mkdir -v dir3
◦ mkdir -m=0100 dir4
◦ cd -
◦ cd path
◦ cd -M path
◦ cd -N path
◦ cd –help
◦ echo text
◦ echo -e hel\wlo
◦ echo -e hel\clo
◦ echo -e hel\wl\co
◦ pwd
◦ pwd -M
◦ pwd -N
